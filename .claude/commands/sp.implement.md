# Implement Command

Execute the implementation based on specification and plan.

## Usage
After specification and planning, use this to guide implementation.

## Process

1. **Setup**
   - Review spec and plan
   - Check prerequisites
   - Ensure environment ready

2. **Implement Phase by Phase**
   For each phase in plan.md:
   - Read phase objectives
   - Complete all tasks
   - Run verification steps
   - Document any deviations

3. **Best Practices**
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
   - Write tests as you go
   - Document decisions in code
   - Update spec if needed

4. **Quality Checks**
   - Does it meet spec requirements?
   - Are tests passing?
   - Is code documented?
   - Performance acceptable?

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Environment setup complete
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Phase 1 complete and verified
- [ ] Phase 2 complete and verified
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for review

## Document Changes
Create PHR (Post-Implementation Historical Record) using `sp.phr` command.

## Next Steps
1. Run tests thoroughly
2. Create PHR documentation
3. Prepare for deployment
