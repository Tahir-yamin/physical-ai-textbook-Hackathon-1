Your First AI-Generated Book: A Step-by-Step Guide

Introduction: From Zero to Published

Welcome! This guide is designed to take you from an absolute beginner to the creator of a complete, AI-generated book. We will walk through every step of the process from scratch, using modern AI development tools. Our approach is all about "learning by doing." Don't worry if you run into issues; encountering and solving problems is the best way to learn, build confidence, and truly understand how these powerful tools work. Let's get started.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Preparing Your Workspace: The Foundation for Success

A proper setup is the most important first step to ensure a smooth and frustration-free development process. We'll create our project space, refresh our credentials, and install the core tool we'll be using.

1.1. Create Your Project Folder

First, we need a dedicated, empty folder for our book project.

1. Open your terminal or command line interface.
2. Create a new directory. We'll call it ai-book.
3. Navigate into your newly created folder. This will be our workspace for the entire project.

1.2. The Golden Rule: Refresh Your Access Tokens

Access tokens are like temporary passwords that allow your tools to communicate with AI services. They expire, so it's a crucial best practice to refresh them before starting any new session. This simple routine will save you from confusing errors later.

A Smarter, Not Harder Approach You might see advice online telling you to delete your entire qainon configuration folder to fix authentication issues. While that can work, it's an unnecessary and destructive habit. The method below is faster, safer, and keeps your settings intact.

1. Open Your Terminal: This is where you'll run all the necessary commands.
2. Start the qainon CLI: Run the following command to launch the interface.
3. Run the Auth Command: Once inside the qainon interface, run this command to refresh your claude token in the background. A success message will confirm it's done.
4. Locate the New Token:
  * Navigate to your user's home directory and find the hidden .qainon folder (the path is typically ~/.qainon).
  * Open this folder in a code editor like VS Code.
  * Inside, open the auth_creds.json file and copy the value of the access_token.
5. Update the Router Config:
  * Navigate back to your home directory, then into the hidden .cloud.router folder.
  * Open the config file.
  * Paste the new access_token you just copied and save the file.

This is a critical file path to remember. It's how your local tools stay authenticated with the AI service. ~/.cloud.router/config

1.3. Install the Core Tool: spectate-plus

spectate-plus is the main tool we'll use to orchestrate the entire book creation process. It provides the sp command that instructs the AI on what to build.

1. Find the Command: For the most up-to-date installation command, it's best to go directly to the source. Navigate to the piaic-university GitHub page and find the spectate-plus repository.
2. Run the Installer: The repository will provide installer commands for different environments (e.g., pip or uv). Run the appropriate command in your terminal. This will install spectate-plus globally, making the sp command available system-wide.

Pro-Tip: It's good practice to occasionally update spectate-plus to get the latest features. The GitHub repository also provides the upgrade command, which is just as easy to run.

Now that your workspace is set up and your tools are ready, it's time to lay the blueprint for your AI project.

2. Initializing Your Project & Crafting the Master Prompts

In this section, we'll create the core files for our project and then, in a clever twist, we'll instruct a separate AI (like Gemini) on how to write the perfect prompts for our book-building AI.

2.1. Initialize the AI Environment

Now, within your ai-book folder, let's initialize the AI development environment.

1. Run the Init Command: In your terminal, make sure you are inside the ai-book folder and run:
2. The . tells the tool to initialize the project in the current directory.
3. Choose Your AI Model: When prompted, select claude. It is highly recommended and works very well for this task.
4. Choose Your Shell: You will be prompted to choose a shell environment.
  * sh: Select this if you are using WSL, Linux, or macOS.
  * ps: Select this if you are using Windows PowerShell. Choose the one that matches your terminal.

2.2. Generate Your Command Prompts with Gemini

Instead of writing complex instructions from scratch, we'll leverage one Language Model (LLM) to generate perfectly formatted prompts for another. This is a powerful technique that saves time and ensures our instructions are clear.

1. Gather Your Source Material: We need two key "ingredients" for our prompt. You can get these from the project documentation or course materials you're working with.

Ingredient	Source
Book Directive	The high-level goal, e.g., "Write a book using DocuSaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages."
Book Topics	The main modules or chapters, e.g., "Overview, Module 1: Getting Started, Module 2: Core Concepts..."

1. Instruct Gemini: Go to Gemini (or another LLM of your choice) and give it the following instruction. This prompt asks it to generate a specific, copy-and-paste-ready prompt for each step of the spectate-plus workflow.
2. Critical Pro-Tip:

With your master prompts generated, you are now ready to command the AI to build your book, one step at a time.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. The Assembly Line: Executing the Build Commands

This is the core of the creation process. We will now run a sequence of sp commands, feeding the AI the master prompts we just generated with Gemini.

3.1. Start the AI Command Line Interface (CLI)

First, let's launch the local development environment that allows us to communicate directly with the AI.

1. Run ccr restart to ensure the router is fresh.
2. Run ccr code to open the AI's command-line interface.

3.2. Power-Up: Add Agents and Skills (Optional but Recommended)

Agents and Skills are files that give the AI specialized knowledge and capabilities for a specific task, like building a book. While this is an optional step for a first run, it's a best practice that leads to better results. In a real-world workflow, it's easy to forget this step until you need it. By adding these files now, you're setting the AI up for success from the very beginning and avoiding backtracking later.

* Before running the creation commands, find the agents and skills files (you can find examples in reference projects).
* Copy these files into the hidden .cloud folder inside your ai-book project directory.

3.3. Execute the Creation Sequence

Now, we will execute the commands one by one in the correct order. For each step, you will paste the corresponding prompt that Gemini generated for you.

1. sp.constitution
  * Purpose: This command sets the fundamental rules, goals, and principles for the entire project. It's the AI's "mission statement."
  * Action: Type sp.constitution, paste the constitution prompt from Gemini, and press Enter.
2. sp.specify
  * Purpose: This command creates the detailed technical specifications for the project, outlining the technologies and structure.
  * Action: Type sp.specify, paste the specify prompt, and press Enter.
3. sp.plan
  * Purpose: This command generates a high-level, step-by-step plan that the AI will follow to build the book.
  * Action: Type sp.plan, paste the plan prompt, and press Enter.
4. sp.task
  * Purpose: This command breaks the high-level plan down into smaller, individual, executable tasks.
  * Action: Type sp.task, paste the task prompt, and press Enter.
5. sp.implementation
  * Purpose: This is the final and most important step. The AI executes all the defined tasks, writing the actual code and content for your book.
  * Action: Type sp.implementation, paste the implementation prompt, and press Enter. Note that this step will take the longest to complete.

3.4. Verifying the Output

The AI has finished its work, but how do you see the result? This is a perfect opportunity to practice interacting with the CLI. Instead of guessing the command, just ask the AI directly.

1. Once the implementation is complete, simply type the following question into the CLI: How do I run the local server for the book you just created?
2. The AI will analyze the project it built and provide the correct command, which is typically:
3. Run that command in your terminal (not the AI CLI) from your ai-book project folder, and your new book should open in your web browser!

4. Troubleshooting and Essential Tips

The moment you get stuck is the moment you truly start learning. Don't worry—these tools are complex, and hitting a roadblock is a sign of progress. Here are some of the most common issues and how to solve them, based on real experience.

* Problem: "My sp commands aren't found!"
  * Solution: This is almost always a folder structure issue. The sp commands are specific to a project and live inside its hidden .cloud folder. If you initialized your project with a name (e.g., sp init my-project), a new folder called my-project was created. You must first navigate into that folder (cd my-project) before the sp commands will be recognized.
* Problem: "My session disconnected in the middle of a long task!"
  * Solution: Don't panic! You don't have to start over. Use the /resume command. After restarting your CLI with ccr code, simply type /resume and press Enter. It will show you a history of previous states. You can select the most recent one to pick up right where you left off.
* Pro-Tip: Example - Connecting the context-serv MCP Server
  * You can give your AI new capabilities by connecting it to MCP (Multi-Capability Provider) servers. Let's walk through connecting context-serv, a popular choice.
    1. Sign up for context-serv and go to your dashboard.
    2. Find the "Cloud Code" integration section on the dashboard. It will provide a command template.
    3. Click the button to generate and copy your new API key.
    4. Paste your API key into the command template provided on the site.
    5. Run the completed command in your regular terminal (not the AI CLI). Your AI now has access to the new service!
